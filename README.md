# MultiplEYE WG1: Experiment Implementation

**NOTE: The README and the specification of how to set everything up is still work in progress**

This repository contains the code for an eye-tracking-while-reading experiment for multiple languages.

## Set environment with our own PyGaze version
We will work 

## Develop experiments for EyeLink
You will need to install `pylink` a package provided by SR Research if you use EyeLink eye-trackers. 
Note that `pip install pylink` installs a different package although the names are the same! Step-by-step instructions
of how to install `pylink` can be found here: [INSTALL_PYLINK.md](guidelines/INSTALL_PYLINK.md)
