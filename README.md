# MultiplEYE WG1: Experiment Implementation
In this repository we will keep the code for the implementation of the eye-tracking experiments. We will implement the experiments using python.

## Setting up the enviornment

## Contributions
Thanks if you consider contributing! We're happy if many people want to join. As not everyone has the same level of experience when it comes to programming in Python 
and working collaboratively on a project we would like to mention a few guidelines for everyone who wants to contribute 
(some of these things might seem obvious to experienced developers, but we would like to encourage less experienced people to contribute as well):

* :left_right_arrow: All contributions are made via a **pull request**. Please open a new branch from main, then you make your changes on that branch and open a PR
to the main branch. Someone will then review the changes and if everything is fine you can merge the branch.
  
* :soap: We try to stick to clean code guidelines. Among other things this means:
    * :white_check_mark: we include type hints (check [this](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) out if you are not familiar with typing in python)
    * :white_check_mark: we use meaningful names and stick to the python [naming conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)
    * :white_check_mark: if you have never heard about clean code, you might want to check [this](https://testdriven.io/blog/clean-code-python/) out. 

In any case: happy coding! :tada:
