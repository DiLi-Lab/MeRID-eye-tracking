# MultiplEYE WG1: Experiment Implementation


You will need to install `pylink` a package provided by SR Research if you use Eyelink eye-trackers. You can install it with the following command (if you use pip):

`pip install --index-url=https://pypi.sr-support.com sr-research-pylink`

Note that `pip install pylink` installs a different package although the names are the same!

SR Research provides a documentation on how to install pylink. You need to create an SR Research account to access 
heo documentation though: https://www.sr-research.com/support/thread-48.html
